# Tenant Security Client Go Library

A Go client for implementing CMK within a vendor's infrastructure. Makes requests through an IronCore Tenant Security Proxy to tenants' KMS/logging infrastructures.

## Getting started

A good place to start is the TenantSecurityClient class, which is what the consumer should always interact with. You can also go check out the [examples](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-go/tree/main/examples).

If you're looking for more examples the usage is very similar to that shown in our [Java Examples](https://github.com/IronCoreLabs/tenant-security-client-java/tree/main/examples).
